## Features
- Simplifies recording macros for one-off macros.
- Instead of having to remember in which register you saved a macro in, you cycle between macro slots. (I'd guess that 90% of vim users never use more than two macros at the same time anywayâ€¦)
- Some quality-of-life features like notifications, the ability to cancel a recording, or a command to edit macros.
- Functions for status line plugins. Particularly useful if you use `cmdheight=0`.
- Uses up-to-date nvim features like `vim.ui.input` or `vim.notify`. This means you can get nicer input fields via plugins like [dressing.nvim](https://github.com/stevearc/dressing.nvim), and nicer confirmation notices with plugins like [nvim-notify](https://github.com/rcarriga/nvim-notify).
- Written 100% in lua. Lightweight (< 150 lines) wrapper around the built-in macro-feature.

## Installation and Configuration

```lua
-- packer
use "chrisgrieser/nvim-recorder"
```

```lua
-- setup is required and will use the default config
require("recorder").setup()
```

```lua
-- configure the plugin. Below are the default values
require("recorder").setup {
	-- Named registers where macros are saved. 
	-- First register is the default register/macro-slot used after startup. 
	-- Be aware that vim saves macros in registers, so using a register inside a 
	-- macro will cause trouble.
	slots = {"a", "b"},

	-- clear the macro-slots/registers on startup/running this setup function
	clear = false,

	-- log level used for any notification. Mostly relevant for nvim-notify. (Note that by default, nvim-notify only shows levels 2 and higher.)
	logLevel = vim.log.levels.INFO,

	-- Mappings
	mapping = {
		startStopRecording = "q",
		playMacro = "Q",
		editMacro = "cq",
		switchSlot = "<C-q>",
	}
}
```

```lua
-- For status line plugins

-- indicates whether you are currently recording. Useful if you are using `cmdheight=0`, where recording-status is not visible.
require("recorder").recordingStatus()

-- displays non-empty macro-slots (registers) and indicates the selected one
-- Recommendation: use with the config `clear = true`
require("recorder").displaySlots()
```

## Usage
- Use the `toggleKey` to start recording. Saves automatically to the current macro slot, so you do not need to specify a register.
- Press the `toggleKey` again to end the recording. When you press it directly after the beginning of the recording (i.e., an empty macro), the keypress is considered a cancellation and the register/macro-slot is not overridden with an empty macro. 
- `.switchMacroSlot()` cycles through the registers you specified in the configuration, and also show a notice with that macro's content.
- `.editMacro()` and `.playRecording()` to pretty much what they say.
