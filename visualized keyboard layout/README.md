## App Switcher
Activated with a single press of `left-ctrl` as leader key.

## Hyper Bindings
`Hyper` is an artificial "fifth" modifier key equivalent to `⌘⌥⌃⇧`. Can be implemented in many ways, on macOS for example:
	- [using Hyperkey](https://hyperkey.app/)
	- [using BetterTouchTool](https://thesweetsetup.com/macos-hyper-key-bettertouchtool/)
	- [using Karabiner Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/)
	- [using Hammerspoon (Advanced)](https://evantravers.com/articles/2020/06/08/hammerspoon-a-better-better-hyper-key/)

It's used for global bindings
