# Visualized Keyboard Layout
Created with the fantastic [Keyboard Layout Editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/).

## Base Layout
The basic look of my keyboard for reference. _Keychron K3 v.2 (70%), blue switches, ISO-de macOS Layout._

- [using Hyperkey](https://hyperkey.app/)
- [using BetterTouchTool](https://thesweetsetup.com/macos-hyper-key-bettertouchtool/)
- [using Hammerspoon (Advanced)](https://evantravers.com/articles/2020/06/08/hammerspoon-a-better-better-hyper-key/)
